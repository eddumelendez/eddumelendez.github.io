    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Database Change Management has been one of the practices which I have not seen much in action but there is a first time for everything. When I started a new project time ago, I was aware of lack of this practice and the risks around. In order to avoid risks in the database and wasting time between team members with backups and restores, I started with the research. During the research, I met <code>Flyway</code> and <code>Liquibase</code>. Both are powerful but <code>liquibase</code> was chosen because meet the needs. You can read my post about <a href="http://eddumelendez.github.io/blog/2014/03/27/database-change-management/">Database Change Management</a> and <a href="http://eddumelendez.github.io/blog/2014/08/11/database-change-management-liquibase/">Database Change Management with Liquibase</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, <code>Flyway</code> and <code>Liquibase</code> are supported by <code>spring-boot</code>. Both help to manage the scripts execution over the database and you can configure using <code>flyway.*</code> and <code>liquibase.*</code> property namespaces. Since version 1.3.0, endpoints for both technologies has been added, their purpose is display data in  <code>schema_version</code>, <code>databasechangelog</code> or any table you have customized. Previous to this change, credentials are required to access to the database in order to know this status. Now, everything is exposed via <code>spring-boot</code> and can be accessed to this information through the following endpoints <code>/flyway</code>, <code>/liquibase</code>.</p>

<p>These new endpoints have arrived thanks to <code>actuator</code> which provide several useful endpoints in <code>spring-boot</code>.</p>

<p>If you are currently using one of these technologies integrated with <code>spring-boot</code> you just need to add the actuator in your dependencies and voilá you can see through the inside.</p>

<p>For maven users:
<code>xml
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-actuator&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></p>

<p>For gradle users:
<code>
org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-actuator
</code></p>

<h2>/flyway endpoint</h2>

<p>Once you have everything configure, point to the endpoint. E.g: <a href="http://localhost:8080/flyway">http://localhost:8080/flyway</a></p>

<pre><code class="json">[  
   {  
      "type":"SQL",
      "checksum":710039845,
      "version":"1",
      "description":"init",
      "script":"V1__init.sql",
      "state":"SUCCESS",
      "installedOn":1441826719448,
      "executionTime":3
   }
]
</code></pre>

<h2>/liquibase endpoint</h2>

<p>Once you have everything configure, point to the endpoint. E.g: <a href="http://localhost:8080/liquibase">http://localhost:8080/liquibase</a></p>

<pre><code class="json">[

    <updated>2014-03-27T22:15:11-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://eddumelendez.github.io/blog/2014/03/27/database-change-management</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First, I have some questions to you:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do you have scripts into the Source Control Management?</li>
<li>Do you know which scripts have been executed into the database?</li>
<li>Do you write scripts for rollback?</li>
<li>Are DBAs involve in your development process?</li>
<li>Tell me, how do you manage your database changes?</li>
</ol>


<p>If I were a new team member, I will ask you how to build my database and maybe this would be your answer &ldquo;Let me get a dump from my local database and I will send you&rdquo;. This is valid if your dump has the same structure that production environment but I would not be 100% sure.
Another option is get a backup from production, is not a bad idea if you want to work with real data and solve a specific issue but is not ever the case. So, you must be able to build the database whenever you want.</p>

<h2>What it is my point?</h2>

<p>Continuous Improvement, that is my point. We need to improve our delivery process every day and Database Change Management is something that you can not forget.</p>

<h2>Which is involve?</h2>

<ol>
<li>Every database modification should be written as a delta script.</li>
<li>Add rollback section to your scripts.</li>
<li>Use a naming conventions for your scripts.</li>
<li>If a delta script has already been applied to a database is subsequently modified that subsequent modification will not be applied to the database.</li>
<li>Version Control your scripts.</li>
<li>Maintain a database changelog.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Advantages</h2>

<ol>
<li>Reduce risks during deployments.</li>
<li>Ensure you are executing the right scripts.</li>
<li>You can build a new database.</li>
</ol>


<p>After this, you can research about some tools such as <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/">liquibase</a> or <a href="http://flywaydb.org/">flyway</a> in order to automated scripts execution and then promote communication with Database Team in your job.</p>
