I am starting writing this blog because I want to share my knowledge and expertise with everyone. Also, I would like to get feedback from others.

My favourite topics are related to:

* Agile Practices
* Java
* Build Tools (Gradle, Maven)
* Mule ESB
* Spring Framework
* Testing

Also, I will share some books that I have taken into consideration during my continuous improvement process.
