This year I had the opportunity to attend at JavaOne 2014 in San Francisco, California. It has been a really good experience to me.

In the JavaHub, I could take a look about:  

- Mission Control.
- 3D Modeling and Printing, using Java FX.
- New features in Netbeans, which allow us to migrate from older java versions to java 8 and use Streams.
- Internet of Things, using Java Embedded and Raspberry Pi.
- Hackergarten, the place where you can contribute in open source projects talking with the experts.

Some companies were present in this event such as:
Cloudbees, GitHub, Gradleware, Hazelcast, JetBrains, JFrog, Liferay, O'Reilly, Pivotal, RedHat, Sonatype, Vaadin, Zeroturnaround.

Also, had the chance to meet:  

- Anton Arhipov - [@antonarhipov](https://twitter.com/antonarhipov), JRebel and XRebel Product Manager at Zeroturnaround.
- Arun Gupta - [@arungupta](https://twitter.com/arungupta), Director of Developer Advocacy at Red Hat and Author of Java EE 7 Essentials.
- Benjamin Muschko - [@bmuschko](https://twitter.com/bmuschko), Principal Engineer at Gradleware and Author of Gradle in Action.
- John Ferguson - [@wakaleo](https://twitter.com/wakaleo), Author of Java Power Tools, Jenkins: The Definitive Guide and BDD in Action.
- Josh Long - [@starbuxman](https://twitter.com/starbuxman), Spring Developer Advocate.
- Phill Weeb - [@phillip_webb](https://twitter.com/phillip_webb), Spring Framework committer and co-lead of Spring Boot.

Below, are the sessions I found most interesting:  

Sunday  

- Introduction to Java 8: JVM, Language, and Platform.
- Starting a JUGgernaut: How to Start and Rapidly Grow Your JUG.
- Java Strategy and Technical Keynotes.

Monday  

- Hadoop for Java Developers. http://goo.gl/f2CwNz
- Next Step in Automation: Elastic Build Environment.
- Programming with Streams in Java 8.

Tuesday  

- Devoxx4Kids for Parents.
- Functional UIs with Java 8 and Vaadin.
- Building a Continuous Delivery Pipeline with Gradle and Jenkins.

Wednesday  

- Continuous Delivery and Zero Downtime: What Your Architecture Needs to Succeed.
- Apache TomEE, Java EE Web Profile, and More on Tomcat.
- REST Assured: Hypermedia APIs with Spring MVC.

Tuesday  

- The Deploy Factory: Open Source Tools for Java Deployment.
- Run Java Applications with Docker on the Raspberry Pi and Other Platforms.

**Java 8** was the main topic during this party, everyone talked about it. As a Venkat Subramaniam said in his talk:

> Java arrived later with lambdas but arrived with the desserts (Streams)

**MVC 1.0** part of **JEE 8** had place at JavaOne... in my opinion looks like Spring MVC but good to know that good things have been adopted.

**JavaOne** is the best place to meet people, authors, learn new things, get stuff like raspberry pi, books and t-shirts and drink a beer.
