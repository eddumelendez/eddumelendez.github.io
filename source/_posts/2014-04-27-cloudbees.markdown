Time ago, I was looking for subversion server. I could have used Google code, but I had a problem with that, it is a public repository. So, I found **Cloudbees** and meets my expectation.

## What is Paas?
Nowadays, we should know about *Platform as a Service*. But, it doesn't matter if you don't know it. You can learn something new everyday. Briefly, PaaS is a environment on cloud based on products from the providers. So, Cloudbees is a **PaaS**. In this case, Cloudbees was built using Sonar, Jenkins, Subversion, Git, MySQL, Tomcat and many other tools.

## What can you find on Cloudbees?
You can find several products such as I have mentioned before, besides JFrog, SendGrid, AppDynamics, New Relic, Mongo HQ.

I suggest to use it at university projects. Sometimes we need to application server, and using Cloudbees we can have source control management, database, application server, maven repository. It is a good place to start teaching about *Continuous Integration*, *Continuous Delivery*.

**Note:** We have to consider that Cloudbees provide a limit space, if you want more space you have to buy.
Cloudbees, is a good service. And I hope you can use it.
