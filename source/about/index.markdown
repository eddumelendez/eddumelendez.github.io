I am 24 years old and live in Per√∫. As a Software Engineer, I have worked in the development of webapp and backend applications in Java programming language.

Nowadays, I am very interested in the following things:

- Learn new things like NoSQL (MongoDB, Neo4j), AngularJS and programming languages such as Ruby and Python.
- Improve my testing skills.
